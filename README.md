Cloud storage system use Replication Algorithm to prevent data loss. The most common algorithm is Random Replication. However, it is almost guaranteed to lose data due to cluster-wide power outages. To solve this problem, we can weigh between the replication groups and recovery time. Generally, fewer replication groups to reduce the possibility of data loss. It turns out that greedy algorithm is much more suitable to generate replication groups in the practical use. However, we found that with long time running of this algorithm, the result of generation is getting worse and divert from the original setting. So we introduce a merging algorithm which can be run periodically. This merging algorithm helps to neutralize the side effects of dynamic cluster changing and reduce the increasing number of replication groups. Then we evaluate the merging cost of this algorithm and give several suggestions of scheduling the merging.
