# Introduction

Replication algorithms are fundamental to cloud storage systems for ensuring data durability and preventing loss. A significant challenge arises with traditional Random Replication, which, despite its simplicity, offers poor protection against large-scale correlated failures like cluster-wide power outages, making data loss almost guaranteed in such scenarios. Prior work, notably "Copysets: Reducing the Frequency of Data Loss in Cloud Storage" by Cidon et al., introduced Copyset Replication to address this by significantly reducing the frequency of data loss events compared to random methods. This is achieved by constraining replica placement to predefined groups of nodes (copysets), minimizing the total number of unique failure units in the system. The Copyset Replication technique involves an offline phase to generate permutations which define the allowed copysets.   

While Copyset Replication effectively reduces the probability of data loss in relatively static environments by optimizing the trade-off between data loss frequency and scatter width, its reliance on pre-generated permutations presents limitations in highly dynamic clusters where nodes frequently join or leave. Greedy algorithms offer more adaptability for generating copysets in changing environments. However, over time, purely greedy approaches in dynamic settings can lead to a degradation in performance, characterized by an uncontrolled increase in the number of copysets.   

This paper builds upon these foundations, addressing the shortcomings of prior methods in dynamic contexts. We combine a greedy algorithm for initial copyset generation with a novel, periodically executable merging algorithm. This merging algorithm is the key contribution, designed specifically to counteract the adverse effects of cluster dynamism. By actively managing and consolidating copysets, the merging process maintains the system's efficiency and controls the number of replication groups over the long term, preserving data resilience even as the cluster evolves. We detail this merging mechanism and evaluate its performance and scheduling considerations in our project report.
